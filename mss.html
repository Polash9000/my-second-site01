    <h2>Saint Martin Travel</h2>
    <img src="Picture/saint1.jpg" width="25%" alt="Saint Martin Picture:2">
</div>
    <p class="content">Millennia ago, the island used to be an extension of the Teknaf peninsula, but at a later time some portion of this peninsula got submerged and thus the southernmost part of the aforementioned peninsula became an island, and was disconnected from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"><strong>Bangladesh</strong></a> mainland. The first settlement started 250 years ago, in 18th century, by Arabian merchants who named the island <b>'Jazira'</b>. During British occupation the island was named after the then Deputy Commissioner of Chittagong Mr. Martin as <strong>St. Martin Island</strong>. Likely because one or more of the Arabs were Saint and whose name could not be identified. Local names of the island are "Narikel jinjira"[3] which means <b>'Coconut Island'</b>, and <b>"Daruchini Dwip"</b> which means <b>"Cinnamon island"</b>. It is the only coral island in Bangladesh.</p>

    <h2>Cox's Bazar Travel</h2>
    <img src="Picture/cox1.JPG" width="25%" alt="Cox's Bazar Picture:2">
</div>
    <p class="content">From the early 9th century the greater <b>Chittagong</b> area, including <strong>Cox's Bazar</strong>, was under the rule of Arakan kings until its conquest by the Mughals in 1666 AD.[4] When the Mughal Prince Shah Shuja was passing through the hilly terrain of the present-day Cox's Bazar on his way to Arakan, he was attracted to its scenic and captivating beauty. He commanded his forces to camp there. His retinue of one thousand palanquins stopped there for some time. A place named Dulahazara, meaning "one thousand palanquins," still exists in the area. After the Mughals, the place came under the control of the Tipras and the Arakanese, followed by the Portuguese and then the British.The name Cox's Bazar originated from the name of a British East India Company officer, Captain Hiram Cox, who was appointed as the Superintendent of Palonki (today's Cox's Bazar) outpost. He succeeded Warren Hastings, who became the Governor of Bengal following the British East India Company Act in 1773. Cox embarked upon the task of rehabilitation and settlement of the Arakanese refugees in the area.[5] He rehabilitated many refugees in the area, but died in 1799 before finishing his work. To commemorate him, a market was established and named after him, called Cox's Bazar. Cox's Bazar was first established in 1854 and became a municipality in 1869.[4]After the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857, the British East India Company was highly criticised on humanitarian grounds, specially for its opium trade monopoly over the Indian Sub-Continent. However, after its dissolution on 1 January 1874, the company's assets, including its armed forces, were acquired by the British Crown. After this takeover, Cox's Bazar was declared a district of the Bengal Province under the British Crown.</p>
